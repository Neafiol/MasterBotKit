# MasterBotKit
A service for building multifunctional telegram bots, which took first place on _Selectel Hackaton_.
The service allows people who are not familiar with programming to create multifunctional bots for Telegram.

The current settings allow you to.
 * Create Text and Inline button menus
 * Maintain CRM accounts
 * Send out newsletters to customers
 * Autofill database with user replies
 * Send and receive files/photo/video from users
 * Run your own scripts and return the generated messages to the user
 
 packed MaterBotKit into a .sh installer and created a little libu to add their own functionality to the bot, as a result the code for the Java Bot (an adjustable queue for taking programs at uni with authorization, adding and quitting the queue with a description of the programs you want to take and an admin panel with the ability to reorder/skip people and do mailings) took 59 lines of code! You just redefine some methods of your parent class without touching anything else, and tweak the bot a bit through the web-interface and it's done! In 20 minutes we created a bot, which would take a day to write from scratch. 

 In general, successful experiments)
